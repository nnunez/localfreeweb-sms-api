Twilio will send our app the request

Our app logs the date, time, phone number and stop ID in this Google Spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S4jHX9__Drog_qqGsDJYFuO7KvRP9BUD8A95xQ5kkQU/edit?usp=sharing 

Our app will ask CartoDB where that bus stop lives
http://localfreeweb.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT stop_lat, stop_lon FROM stops WHERE stop_id = 660

CartoDB will return the lat, lon

Our Flask app will use that lat, lon to ask CartoDB to give us the three locations closest to that lat, lon
http://localfreeweb.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT name, ST_Distance(the_geom::geography, ST_PointFromText('POINT(-122.475096 37.72119)', 4326)::geography) AS distance FROM freeweb ORDER BY distance ASC LIMIT 3

Our Flask app will then tell Twilio to text the data back to the user
